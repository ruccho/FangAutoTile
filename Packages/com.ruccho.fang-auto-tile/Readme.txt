What is Fang Auto Tile? ----------------------------------------

Fang Auto Tile provides easier way to use auto tiles in Unity Tilemap system.

Generally, auto tiles are tiles which change their own appearances depending on whether the neighboring tile is the same tile. Most implementions of auto tiles require so many kinds of sprite assets of tiles, but Fang Auto Tile requires only 5. If you create assets in compliance with the given format, it automatically creates all the patterns.
The material format is a superset of one in WOLF RPG Editor (https://www.silversecond.com/WolfRPGEditor/), which is a popular game development software especially in Japan.
