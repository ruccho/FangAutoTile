What is Fang Auto Tile? ----------------------------------------
Fang Auto Tile provides easier way to use auto tiles in Unity Tilemap system.
It is compatible with the format of WOLF RPG Editor.

Generally, auto tiles are tiles which change their own appearances depending on whether the neighboring tile is the same tile. Most implementions of auto tiles require so many kinds of sprite assets of tiles, but Fang Auto Tile requires only 5. If you create assets in compliance with the given format, it automatically creates all the patterns.
The format is based on that of auto tile system of WOLF RPG Editor (https://www.silversecond.com/WolfRPGEditor/) so you can use assets made for it.
